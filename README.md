## Introduction
Access to clean water is a fundamental human need and a major challenge for many developing countries, including Tanzania. With a population of over 57 million, providing clean water to all citizens is a critical task. There are many water points already established in Tanzania, but some are in dire need of repair while others have completely failed. 
In order to address this challenge, we aim to build a classifier to predict the condition of water wells based on information such as the type of pump used and the installation date. This tool will be instrumental in helping NGOs locate wells that need repair and the government of Tanzania to identify patterns in non-functional wells, which can inform the construction of new wells. This is a ternary classification problem, but can be designed to be binary. With this project, we hope to improve access to clean water for the people of Tanzania and help address this critical need.

## Business Understanding
Tanzania struggles to provide clean water to its population due to the failure or in need of repair of some of its existing water wells.There is a need to improve access to clean water in Tanzania. With a population of over 57 million, it is important to ensure that as many water wells as possible are functional and providing clean water to those who need it. 
The lack of access to clean water not only affects the health and well-being of the population, but also hinders the economic and social development of the country.. By building a classifier that can predict the condition of a water well, organizations such as NGOs and the government can more efficiently identify and repair non-functional wells and make informed decisions about the construction of new wells.The benefits of this project include improved water accessibility for the population of Tanzania, better management of existing wells, and data-driven decision-making for the government.
